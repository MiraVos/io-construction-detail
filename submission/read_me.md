This folder contains files for the final submission. 

The main code is contained in the notebook disaggregation_main.ipynb

Data inputs are found in the folders data (IOTs) and external_data (other data).

To run the notebook, additional files are necessary which could not be uploaded to this folder due to their size. These include ICIO tables:
- ICIOcp_2018.csv
- ICIOcp_2010.csv to ICIOcp_2019.csv are additionally necessary to create some of the graphs

For running only parts of the code, first, the following files need to be generated:
- Z_subrow_CONFIGURATION.csv
- Z_sub_CONFIGURATION.csv

The code produces graphs that are stored in the folder images, and files that are stored in the folder processed_data.

read_mym.py is only needed to import a file for the material intensity of electricity grids.
